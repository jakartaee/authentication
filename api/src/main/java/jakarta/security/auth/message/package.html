        Jakarta Authentication 
    </title>
    <body>
        This package defines the core interfaces of Jakarta Authentication. 
        
        The SPI defines the interfaces by which pluggable authentication mechanisms (aka message authentication modules) may be configured 
        and invoked by a container (aka message processing runtimes).
        
        The term "message" in this context derives from Message Level Security (MLS) vs Transport Level Security (TLS).
